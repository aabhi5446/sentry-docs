To get started manually sending traces you can:

- Set a uniform sample rate for all transactions, by setting the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> option in your SDK config to a number between `0` and `1`. (For example, to send 20% of transactions, set <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `0.2`.)
- Control the sample rate dynamically, based on the transaction itself and the context in which it's captured, by providing a function to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> config option.

Or alternatively:

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<application>
  <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
</application>
```

Or, if you are manually instrumenting Sentry:

```java {tabTitle:Java}
import io.sentry.android.core.SentryAndroid;

SentryAndroid.init(this,
  options -> {
    options.setDsn("___PUBLIC_DSN___");
    // To set a uniform sample rate
    options.setTracesSampleRate(1.0);
    // OR if you prefer, determine traces sample rate based on the sampling context
    options.setTracesSampler(
        context -> {
          // return a number between 0 and 1
        });
  });
```

```kotlin {tabTitle:Kotlin}
import io.sentry.android.core.SentryAndroid
import io.sentry.SentryOptions.TracesSamplerCallback

SentryAndroid.init(this) {
    it.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    // To set a uniform sample rate
    it.tracesSampleRate = 1.0
    // OR if you prefer, determine traces sample rate based on the sampling context
    it.tracesSampler = TracesSamplerCallback {
        // return a number between 0 and 1
    }
}
```
