description: Learn about reprocessing errors with new debug files and source maps.
---

Sentry uses [debug information
files](/platforms/native/data-management/debug-files/) or
[source maps](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/) only after they have been uploaded. _Reprocessing_ allows you to apply source maps and debug information files to error events that have already occurred.

<Note>

This feature is available only if you're in the Early Adopter program. Features available to Early Adopters are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.
If you’re interested in being an Early Adopter, you can turn your organization’s Early Adopter status on/off in General Settings. This will affect all users in your organization and can be turned back off just as easily.

</Note>

After becoming an Early Adopter, you will find a new button when viewing an issue:

!["Reprocess this issue" button next to Resolve, Ignore, Share, Delete actions in issue details page](reprocessing-btn.png)

The dialogue behind it asks you two questions:

* _How many events to reprocess_ -- When left empty, all events are reprocessed
  and potentially move to other (new or existing) issues if the stacktrace
  changed significantly. When 20 is entered, the 20 most recent events will be
  reprocessed and the rest of the issue will be left intact.

* _What to do with remaining events_ -- If you choose to reprocess only 20
  events out of 100, you can choose what to do with the remaining 80 events.
  The default is to keep them where they are (the issue you're viewing).
  Alternatively you may choose to delete them.

After hitting _Reprocess Events_, **the issue will be locked and hidden from
your issue stream while reprocessing is ongoing**. As data is migrated between
issues we allow no actions such as resolving or assigning the issue to ensure
data consistency and avoid data loss.

Note that you can still get to the issue manually by searching for
`is:reprocessing` (removing all other search terms) to get around those
restrictions if you have to.

## Caveats

The dialogue for starting reprocessing lists a couple of caveats that you
should really familiarize yourself with and understand before starting.

* **Data glitches.** During reprocessing you may observe temporary data
  inconsistencies across the entire product. You may observe an event belong to
  two issues at once, and appear in Discover queries twice.

  Those inconsistencies disappear the second reprocessing is done, however
  depending on your platform and the amount of events involved this can take a
  while.

* **Attachment storage needs to be enabled.** If your events come from
  minidumps or unreal crash reports, you need to make sure to have [attachment
  storage](/platforms/native/enriching-events/attachments/#crash-reports-and-privacy)
  enabled. **If the original minidump no longer exists in Sentry, sending an
  event through reprocessing will cause it to have no stacktrace at all.**

* **Quota applies.** Every event you choose to reprocess will count against
  your plan's quota a second time. Rate limits and spike protection do not
  apply.

* **Debug files don't apply immediately.** When uploading debug information
  files, regardless whether to your own symbol server or to Sentry, they are
  only applied after one hour after internal caches have expired. Please wait
  at least 1 hour after uploading DIFs before reprocessing.

* **Alerts do not apply, with caveats.** Issue alerts do not trigger for
  reprocessed events, and the new events are not subject to data forwarding.

  Metric alerts generally do not trigger either, however are subject to the
  aforementioned data inconsistencies. If you have created a metric alert with
  a 24-hour measurement window, and an event you reprocess happened in the last
  24 hours, it will temporarily be counted twice. This may set off the metric
  alert.

## Legacy Reprocesing

Sentry can suspend incoming crash reports until all required debug information
files have been uploaded. **This feature is also called Reprocessing.** It can
be configured in _Project Settings > Processing Issues_. By default, this
feature is disabled.

If enabled, crash reports with missing debug files will not be displayed in the
issues stream. Instead, you will receive a warning that events cannot be
processed until all debug files have been uploaded.

It is not recommended to enable this project setting as it has several flaws,
the most important of which is that it does not work properly with minidumps or
Unreal crash reports. Reprocessing existing issues as shown above is supposed
to replace this functionality.
