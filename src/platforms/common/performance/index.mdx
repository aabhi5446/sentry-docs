<Alert level="info" title="Do you need to set up?">

The Getting Started page for our SDKs already include codes samples to, well, enable Performance Monitoring. That means that you won’t need to spend any more time or energy setting it up and you can proceed straight to our content about how you <PlatformLink to="/performance/capturing/">Manage Transactions</PlatformLink> and get on with your life.

If you installed the SDK a while back, congrats. Now all you need to do is enable tracing as documented here. If you’re on a legacy plan, you'll also need to add transaction events to your [subscription](https://sentry.io/pricing/).

</Alert>

Performance monitoring augments your existing error data by capturing interactions among your software systems. With performance monitoring, Sentry tracks your software performance, measuring metrics like throughput and latency, and displaying the impact of errors across multiple systems.

By monitoring the performance of your application, you can see how latency in one service may affect another service to pinpoint exactly which parts of a given operation may be responsible. To do this, Sentry captures distributed traces consisting of transactions and spans, which measure individual services and individual operations within those services, respectively. You can learn more about this model in [Distributed Tracing](/product/performance/distributed-tracing/).

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript"]} notSupported={["react-native"]}>

Once tracing is enabled, certain types of operations are measured automatically. To learn more, see <PlatformLink to="/performance/capturing/automatic/">Automatic Instrumentation</PlatformLink>.

You can also choose to manually measure any operation. To learn more, see <PlatformLink to="/performance/capturing/manual/">Manual Instrumentation</PlatformLink>.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["react-native"]} notSupported={["javascript"]}>

Currently, the `@sentry/react-native` SDK does not provide automatic instrumentation. To learn how to measure an operation, see <PlatformLink to="/performance/capturing/manual/">Manual Instrumentation</PlatformLink>.

## Install

Install the tracing package:

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/install-tracing-package" />

</PlatformSection>

## Configure the Sample Rate

Once you configure the sample rate, tracing will be enabled in your app. Set the sample rate for your transactions by either:

1. Setting a uniform sample rate for all transactions using the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> option in your SDK config to a number between `0` and `1`. (For example, to send 20% of transactions, set <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `0.2`.)
2. Controlling the sample rate dynamically, based on the transaction itself and the context in which it's captured, by providing a function to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> config option.

The two options are meant to be mutually exclusive. If you set both, <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> will take precedence.

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/configure-sample-rate" />

Learn more about how the options work in <PlatformLink to="/performance/sampling/">Sampling Transactions</PlatformLink>.

## Verify

<PlatformSection supported={["react-native"]} notSupported={["javascript"]}>

You can now test out tracing by starting and finishing a transaction. You can learn how to do so with <PlatformLink to="/performance/capturing/manual/">Manual Instrumentation</PlatformLink>

</PlatformSection>

When you first enable tracing, verify it is working correctly by setting <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `1.0` as that ensures that every transaction will be sent to Sentry.

Once testing is complete, **we recommend lowering this value in production** by either lowering your <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> value, or switching to using <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> to dynamically sample and filter your transactions.

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript"]} notSupported={["react-native"]}>

Without sampling, our automatic instrumentation will send a transaction any time any user loads any page or navigates anywhere in your app, which is a lot of transactions! Sampling enables representative data without overwhelming either your system or your Sentry transaction quota.
