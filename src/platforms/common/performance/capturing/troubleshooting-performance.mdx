## Group Transactions

When Sentry captures transactions, they are assigned a transaction name. This name is generally auto-generated by the Sentry SDK based on the framework integrations you are using. If you can't leverage the automatic transaction generation (or want to customize how transaction names are generated) you can use a global event processor that is registered when you initialize the SDK with your configuration.

## Control Data Truncation

Currently, every tag has a maximum character limit of 200 characters. Tags over the 200 character limit will become truncated, losing potentially important information. To retain this data, you can split data over several tags instead.

For example, a 200+ character tagged request:

`https://empowerplant.io/api/0/projects/ep/setup_form/?user_id=314159265358979323846264338327&tracking_id=EasyAsABC123OrSimpleAsDoReMi&product_name=PlantToHumanTranslator&product_id=161803398874989484820458683436563811772030917980576`

The 200+ character request above will become truncated to:

`https://empowerplant.io/api/0/projects/ep/setup_form/?user_id=314159265358979323846264338327&tracking_id=EasyAsABC123OrSimpleAsDoReMi&product_name=PlantToHumanTranslator&product_id=1618033988749894848`

## Connect Backend and Frontend Transactions

To connect backend and frontend transactions into a single coherent trace, Sentry uses a `trace_id` value which is propagated between frontend and backend. Depending on the circumstance, this id is transmitted either in a request header or in an HTML `<meta>` tag. Linking transactions in this way makes it possible for you to navigate between them in the Sentry UI, so you can better understand how the different parts of your system are affecting each other. You can learn more about this model in our [Distributed Tracing](/product/performance/distributed-tracing/) docs.

### Pageload

When enabling tracing in both frontend and backend as well as taking advantage of automatic frontend instrumentation, you can connect the automatically-generated `pageload` transaction on the frontend with the request transaction that serves the page on the backend. Because JavaScript code running in a browser cannot read the response headers of the current page, the `trace_id` must be transmitted in the response itself, specifically in a `<meta>` tag in the `<head>` of the HTML sent from your backend.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="sentry-trace" content="{{ span.toTraceparent() }}" />
    <!-- ... -->
  </head>
</html>
```

The `name` attribute must be the string `"sentry-trace"` and the `content` attribute must be generated by your backend's Sentry SDK using `span.toTraceparent()` (or equivalent, depending on the backend platform). This guarantees that a new and unique value will be generated for each request.

The `span` reference is either the transaction that serves the HTML, or any of its child spans. It defines the parent of the `pageload` transaction.

Once the data is included in the `<meta>` tag, our `BrowserTracing` integration will pick it up automatically and link it to the transaction generated on pageload. (Note that it will not get linked to automatically-generated `navigation` transactions, that is, those which don't require a full page reload. Each of those will be the result of a different request transaction on the backend, and therefore should have a unique `trace_id`.)

### Navigation and Other XHR Requests

Once a page is loaded, any requests it makes (and any requests your backend makes as a result) are linked through a request header.

As is the case with the `<meta>` tag discussed above, the header's name is `sentry-trace` and its value is obtained by calling `span.toTraceparent()` (or the equivalent), where `span` is either the relevant transaction or any of its children.

All of Sentry's tracing-related integrations (`BrowserTracing`, `Http`, and `Express`) either generate or pick up and propagate this header automatically as appropriate, for all transactions and spans which they generate. You can also attach and read the header yourself, in any case in which you've manually created either a transaction or a span and it makes sense to do so.
